# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors – Python Project

Hey there! 👋 This is one of my beginner Python projects where I created a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game. It helped me understand how to use conditionals, loops, and user input in Python.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

It’s a console-based game where:
- You play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
- You input your choice.
- The computer randomly selects its move.
- The winner is decided based on the classic rules.

### Example Gameplay:

→ 1
You chose: Paper
Computer chose: Rock
You win! 🎉
